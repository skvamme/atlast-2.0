\ Example code for words generating a random number
\ Using SRANDOM MAXRANDOM TIME and EMIT. There is also a word RANDOM.
\
\ TIME leaves julian time on the stack (number of seconds since 19700101).
\ Use it as seed for SRANDOM and call MAXRANDOM with 127 on the stack to get random
\ numbers from 0 to 127. EMIT then prints the number as a character.

: TEST TIME SRANDOM 127 MAXRANDOM EMIT CR ;
